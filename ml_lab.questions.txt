Lab Questions
=======================
1. [4,2,5,2,6,10]

2. The function f will take an input list and add 1 to every element in the list

3. function f with an input of an empty list will return an empty list

4. the overloaded function f with an input of a list where x is the first number in the list and xs is the rest of the list. The function f will add 1 to x and recursively call f with the input of xs

11. I enjoyed changing my way of thinking to utilizing more recursive methods.

12. I dislike the error messages as they tell you very little about what the program is doing to cause it to run into the issue.

13. I liked the challenge of the lab. I thought it was difficult by having me be forced to think in a different way of thinking.

14. I'd say between coding and debugging, I have spend 16 hours on this lab.

15. I might use ML if I have to make a program that relies on a lot of recursive functions such as for a scientific study. Otherwise, I would not use this language for many other functions.
