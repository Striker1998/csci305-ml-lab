Lab Questions
=======================
1. [4,2,5,2,6,10]

2. The function f will take an input list and add 1 to every element in the list

3. function f with an input of an empty list will return an empty list

4. the overloaded function f with an input of a list where x is the first number in the list and xs is the rest of the list. The function f will add 1 to x and recursively call f with the input of xs

5. false : bool

6. My isMember function uses tail recursion to determine if an input is a member of a set.

7. best times, it was the worst of times

8. Tail recursion is useful primarily because the recursion can be optimized by the compiler. This is because the calling function does no more computations after the recursive call. With head-recursion, the computation is done after the recursion call and cannot be optimized which makes tail-recursion more efficient.

9.

11. I enjoyed changing my way of thinking to utilizing more recursive methods.

12. I dislike the error messages as they tell you very little about what the program is doing to cause it to run into the issue.

13. I liked the challenge of the lab. I thought it was difficult by having me be forced to think in a different way of thinking.

14. I'd say between coding and debugging, I have spend 16 hours on this lab.

15. I might use ML if I have to make a program that relies on a lot of recursive functions such as for a scientific study. Otherwise, I would not use this language for many other functions.
