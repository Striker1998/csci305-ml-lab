Lab Questions
=======================
1. [4,2,5,2,6,10]

2. The function f will take an input list and add 1 to every element in the list

3. function f with an input of an empty list will return an empty list

4. the overloaded function f with an input of a list where x is the first number in the list and xs is the rest of the list. The function f will add 1 to x and recursively call f with the input of xs

5. false : bool

6. My isMember function uses tail recursion to determine if an input is a member of a set.

7. {best times, it was the worst of times}

8. Tail recursion is useful primarily because the recursion can be optimized by the compiler. This is because the calling function does no more computations after the recursive call. With head-recursion, the computation is done after the recursion call and cannot be optimized which makes tail-recursion more efficient.

9. { green eggs and ham }

10.{ and macaroni }

11. I enjoyed changing my way of thinking to solving problems using recursive methods.

12. I disliked little about the ML lab, it was confusing at first and seemed hard to figure out where the data was going, but after a bit of research, it was very simple.

13. I liked the challenge of the lab. I thought it was difficult by having me forced to think in a different way of thinking, but now I prefer thinking recursively.

14. I'd say between coding and debugging, I have spend 16 hours on this lab.

15. I might use ML if I have to make a program that relies on a lot of recursive functions such as for a scientific study. Otherwise, I would not use this language for many other functions.
